      | There's probably a lot to say about this app when it comes to comparing it with paper by 53, and lots of it has been already covered in the App-Store comments. Nevertheless, if you like paper, you will instantly feel at ease with flipink as well. It is pretty much the same deal, adding mainly a simple zoom and a color swatch history to your tool shed. I Like using paper for it's simplicity and it's the same with flipink: a simple intuitive painting app, great for sketches and fast, no-layer approach. One unique thing aded is the calendar view which makes this a real nice app for daily sketches, too.

      |  in one of my kids-workshops lately: at the moment it seems to me that this is one of the best apps to start fingerpainting. It has the usual sets of tools you would expect, plus a very nice pattern tool that (and in combination with the mirror-mode) let's you easily create simple and quick paintings. It's an universal app, so it works on all iOS devices.

      | Step 1: Paint the characters
      
    p
      | In this case, the overall theme was monsters. A group of 8 pupils aged 9-14 started off by creating their own set of characters. We used

      | Step 2: getting 3-dimensional
    p
      | Since we wanted to create a stop motion movie with real puppet like characters, we now started using our next app, 
      a href="itms://itunes.apple.com/de/app/foldify/id527118971"
        | Foldify
      | . This handy app lets you paint on ready-to-use 3d figures. In this case we imported our previously created monsters via the photo library and only added some details. Once done, you can print the model directly or send an email with a pdf to somebody you know and who has a printer.

      | Now it's time to get your hands off the screen. And that's the beauty of this process, it very naturally combines material and data to quickly create something new.

      | Step 4: it's time to animate!
    p
      | Now that we have our full cast produced, and also made up our mind about a storyline (which could be anything from a new take on romeo&juliet to a completely made-up thing), it's time to fire up 
      a href="itms://itunes.apple.com/de/app/stop-motion-studio/id441651297"
        | Stop Motion Studio
      | . Stop motion animation basically means shooting a lot of single photos and then play them back with a speed of at least 12 shots per second. This might be the hardest part, since you really have to think about how a character or an object (e.g. a car) moves, how it stops, and maybe for how long it doesn't do anything at all.

      | Step 5: adding sound
    p
      | Once you're done shooting, you can review your movie and check if speed is right, or if you missed something. No worries, you can always add more shots in between, or duplicate single frames to stretch certain parts of your film. The last step is to add a sound track to it: for this you can use anything you find and of course also your own voices. Here's a little example.

      | Aiding kids to read is not merely about teaching the skill of reading; it is also about conveying the joy of reading and literature as a whole. Words can create whole worlds, and worlds ignite your imagination. And for that, it doesn't really matter if you read a paper book or a story on a touch-device. Now there's more and more apps that tell children stories in an interactive, touchable way. Are those vialble companions to the old paper book? Or can they even extend the reading experience?

  h3 Touch, and be touched
  article
    p 
      | Back in the desktop days, there were already many attempts to engage kids with cd-roms and multimedia driven stories. The problem was you always had to use and input device, like a mouse or a keyboard. This was in indirection, which the direct touch-interface has overcome now. In a way, the digital world. has been re-naturalized (Prof. Paolo Ferri, 2013).
    p
      | But there's a catch with that kind of re-naturalization: our expectations of what a more paper-book-like reading experience is fueled by what we have learned by using those objects. The fact is: an app is not a book, there is no paper, it has no weight. It's made of light and code. So we will have to learn and understand not where interactively driven stories are similar to books, but where they are different. How they can extend the reading experience and offer something new.

      | In the first days of the tablets they were often referred to as cosumption devices: to read news, listen to music, watch a movie. Many mobile artists all over the world have show that tablets are fantastic creation devices, too. And in that sense they can be used to engage children, to ignite their creativity as well.

  h3 Conclusion: Do children need the book as an object?
  article
    p 
      | In my opinion, stories always remain what they are: stories. They help us to understand and discover the world in and around us. Interactively driven stories can tickle the kid's curiosity to get into action. Reaching the end of the story can become a success with a new meaning. Or, the freely chosen path through the story can beome meaningful in an owen way.
    p
      | But there's also a new way for adults and children to have a mutual experience. And since it's the kids who are not bound so heavily to previous experiences with stories, it's the adults that can learn from the kids, too. As touching means to be touched, teaching means to learn.

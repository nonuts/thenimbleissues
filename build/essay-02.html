It seems as though it’s one of those concepts that works in theory but not in practice. In the past, I’ve engaged in collaborative gestures that were always not quite what I was after. It seems as though the idea is there but when people work together, they have a problem synthesizing an idea. What happens is that the idea gets watered down and people, very good artists, get wishy washy results.</p><p>I’ve always shied away from these projects which were good in theory, but not in practice. The number of artists was a risk for me because we were working virtually across email with one artist’s responding to another. But that all changed when I started to work with other people who were in a community of like-minded artists who were truly experiencing something shared across long distances and it was like that reticence I felt about collaborative ventures dissolves.</p><p>It was with this spirit that I gladly approached my colleagues, and asked them to collaborate with me in a series of shared works for display in the exhibition “Stylectrical: Design That Has Made History” Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe/Hamburg, Germany.  </p><p>I chose a top crew of artists whom I respected because of their unique vision and their work ethic. </p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gabrielpalacios/?referrer=Baker" id="gabrielpalacios">Gabriel Palacios</a> is what I would call a visionary artist whose characters and surface patterns are engaging to a number of viewers. He designs interactive games, and he throws in his design sensitivity into his work.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ca_newsom/?referrer=Baker" id="craignewsom">Craig Newsom</a> is a painter and a college professor and a master of mixed media at Blackburn College. He was a logical choice due to his comical, spiritual figures, which defy classification and the symmetry in his designs.  </p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/salnavarro/?referrer=Baker" id="salnavarro">Sal Narravo</a> one of the best caricaturists in the Ipad, community and one of the best in the world.  His vision and his speed are top notch. I thought that I could work with these artists well.  </p><p>What happened with the pieces was something unexpected.  I thought coming in that it might be a mess, and sometimes, it was!  But the overall result was something that was quite remarkable.  I got to see things about myself that I couldn’t have seen without the collaboration.  It was really unbelievable what I was getting out of each artist.  Each one was responding to the other in really sympathetic ways that seemed to be feeding off the other.  I remember getting back an iteration from an artist that was totally not what I thought it would be.  It was really surprising how each artist filtered his vision through other artists in a way that none of us could have seen happening. There was a collective genius about it.</p><p>It seems as though I was sharing in something unprecedented.  I don’t think that the rest of us had done it much before.  It seems as though we were experiencing a new model of art, and it was very much about cooperation and collaboration as a new working model that had new rules.</p></article></section><section class="slideshow"><article><div class="flexslider"><ul class="slides"><li><img src="images/portrait/4-panel-5.jpg" /></li><li><img src="images/portrait/4-panel-6.jpg" /></li><li><img src="images/portrait/4-panel-4.jpg" /></li><li><img src="images/portrait/4-panel-1.jpg" /></li><li><img src="images/portrait/4-panel-2.jpg" /></li></ul></div></article></section><script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
